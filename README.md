MARTINI
The inspiration for Martini came from me looking to do freelance videography but not being able to either find a scene location on time or at a specified budget.
Martini is an web service that allows filmmakers search for film sets in the palm of their hand. This works with a wide arrange of film budgets and makes it simple to find a film location in unfamiliar cities. It could also be a way to help people promote/sell their properties and businesses by having them in the eyes of the public.
